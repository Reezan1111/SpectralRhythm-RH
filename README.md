# SpectralRhythm-RH

This project simulates a toy Dirac operator constructed from the logarithms of primes to explore potential spectral connections to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Inspired by Alain Connes’ noncommutative geometry framework, the project builds a bridge between number theory, quantum chaos, and operator theory.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- `code/` - Python modules for Dirac operator construction and spectral analysis
- `data/` - Eigenvalue datasets (e.g., for primes ≤ N)
- `paper/` - LaTeX draft of the paper including references and figure directory
- `sandbox/` - Exploratory and speculative extensions (e.g., p-adic models, Clifford algebras)

## 📊 Features

- Generate truncated Dirac operators from prime logarithms
- Compute eigenvalues and compare spacing with GUE predictions
- Spectral action computation (planned)
- Integration with Overleaf for collaborative paper writing

## 🧠 Inspiration

- Montgomery-Odlyzko law and random matrix theory
- Connes' spectral realization of zeta zeros
- Potential applications of noncommutative metric geometry

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib primesieve
```

## 📈 Example Usage

Run the simulation and analysis notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook run_simulation.ipynb
```
